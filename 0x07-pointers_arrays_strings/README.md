# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**. It aims to teach What are pointers to pointers and how to use them, What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them, and What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
