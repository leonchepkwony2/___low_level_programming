# C - Bit manipulation

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about bit manipulation in C for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Files
The following files are available for this project :

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-binary_to_uint.c`        |function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. |
| `1-print_binary.c`          |function that prints the binary representation of a number.|
| `2-get_bit.c`               |function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. |
| `3-set_bit.c`               |function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. |
| `4-clear_bit.c`             |function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. |
| `5-flip_bits.c`             |function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. |
|`100-get_endianness.c`       |function that checks the endianness |
|`101-password`               |Find the password for <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x13.c">this program.</a> |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project about bit manipulation in C was completed as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Program. The project focused on manipulating bits and using bitwise operators, and encouraged the development of the skill of searching for the right sources of information. The project included several files, each with a specific function related to bit manipulation, and were compiled using gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Overall, this project provided a good introduction to bit manipulation and its importance in software engineering
