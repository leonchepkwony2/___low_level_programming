# C - Function pointers

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about variadic functions for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* What are variadic functions
* How to use `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` macros
* Why and how to use the const type qualifier
