# C - Singly linked lists

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about Data Structures in C for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists
