# C - File I/O

This project on File I/O in C was completed as part of my studies in Full Stack Software Engineering at ALX Program, as per the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Look for the right source of information online
* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
* What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call

## Files
The following files are available for this project :

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_textfile.c`         |function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output. |
| `1-create_file.c`           | function that creates a file.|
| `2-append_text_to_file.c`   |function that appends text at the end of a file. |
| `3-cp.c`                    |program that copies the content of a file to another file. |
| `100-elf_header.c`          |program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file. |



## Conclusion

In conclusion, completing this project on File I/O in C has provided valuable insights and knowledge in various aspects of file handling, such as creating, opening, closing, reading, and writing files, as well as understanding file descriptors, file permissions, and system calls. By utilizing various resources, such as online information and tools like vi and vim editors, and compiling files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options, this project has successfully achieved its learning objectives. Overall, this project has enriched the skills and expertise in Full Stack Software Engineering, preparing for further challenges and opportunities in the field.
