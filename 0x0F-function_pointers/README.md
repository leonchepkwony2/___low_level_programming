# C - Function pointers

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about function pointers for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

*Editors used: vi, vim
*All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Files
The following files are available for this project :

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c`     |function that prints a name. |
| `1-array_iterator.c` |function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.|
| `2-int_index.c`      |function that searches for an integer. |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` |program that prints the opcodes of its own main function. |
