# C - More malloc, free

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project on memory allocation for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All  files aree compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Concepts

In this project, we will be looking at the following concept:

* Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free


## Resources

* <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc"> Do I Cast The Result of Malloc?</a>
* `man or `help`:
	* exit(3)
	* calloc
	* realloc

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* How to use the exit function
* What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

## Files
The following files are available for this project :

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-malloc_checked.c`     |function that allocates memory using `malloc` |
| `1-string_nconcat.c`	   |function that concatenates two strings |
| `2-calloc.c`             |function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc` |
| `3-array_range.c`        |  function that creates an array of integers |
| `100-realloc.c`          |function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free` |
| `101-mul.c`              |program that multiplies two positive numbers. |
